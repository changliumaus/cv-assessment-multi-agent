About Us 🚀

At Relevance AI, we’re building the home of the AI workforce.

Our mission is simple: empower every team to delegate meaningful work to AI agents that think, act, and collaborate like experts.

With Relevance AI, anyone can create and manage intelligent agents that handle workflows, decisions, and collaboration - all within one unified platform. Our technology already powers industry leaders such as Canva, Databricks, Confluent, Autodesk, Lightspeed, Rakuten, Aveva, Qualified, and Activision Blizzard, helping them scale excellence across operations, marketing, and sales.

We’re backed by Bessemer Venture Partners, Insight Partners, Peak XV, and King River Capital, and raised our Series B in April 2025 to accelerate growth and push the boundaries of agentic automation.

Headquartered in San Francisco and Sydney, we operate on a hybrid model and thrive on curiosity, collaboration, and execution - we move fast, think big, and win together.

This year, we were proud to be named LinkedIn’s #1 Startup in Australia.

The Role 🥳

We’re seeking talented AI engineers (fullstack) to join our team and build next-generation AI-powered applications. This role would be ideal for individuals who are excited by the intersection of software development and applied AI.

This is not a traditional ML engineer/ MLops role. Your day to day will be varied and you’ll work on building real, user-facing AI features—powering workflows, tools, and experiences that leverage large language models and agents across the product. Expect to dive deep into prompt engineering, AI-powered backend services, and full stack implementations (APIs, microservices, and frontends alike).

You’ll collaborate closely with a visionary product and engineering team, contribute to our open-source SDKs, expand internal agent frameworks, and shape the future of AI agent interfaces and infrastructure.

Your impact💥

Develop Agents and Multi-agent systems: Design and implement AI agent and extend existing agents with new capabilities. This includes managing the agent’s context (using techniques like sub-agents, retrieval based context management, sliding context windows, etc.).
Develop Tools for agents: Develop complex tools for agents like computer use, browser use, etc.
Multi-agent orchestration and tool calling: Research and develop systems on how agents should collaborate, and how agents should call tools.
Fullstack development: Build and maintain production-grade APIs and AI-powered features, from backend services to user-facing experiences.
Evaluate and improve: Evaluate AI’s performance using evaluations and tests to then iterate on prompts, agent tools and agents orchestration to improve output quality and reliability.

What We’re Looking For 🧠

4+ years in full-stack software development, ideally developing practical and production-ready AI applications or features that utilise Gen AI/ LLMs / RAG.
Strong programming skills in Python and Javascript, including experience using AI-assisted coding tools.
Deep understanding of foundational models, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning techniques.
Understanding of software design, service architecture, and scalable systems.
Passion for building AI-enhanced user experiences, not just theoretical ML solutions.
Prior start-up or tech company experience is a plus—especially where you’ve worn multiple hats or shaped early products.
Bonus: Side projects or open-source contributions involving building AI agents, RAG pipelines, or open-source LLM tooling.

Our Tech-Stack: Javascript

 Typescript (Node.js)
 Python
 React/ Vue.js
 Express.js
 LLMs

Why Join Us? 🌟

Work at the forefront of AI with a nimble team that is constantly pushing boundaries. We encourage and celebrate ideas that drive our mission forward.

We’ve set high standards in our high-trust, low-ego environment. We hire exceptional people to do the best work of their lives. In return, we reward our people with competitive salaries, equity stake, unparalleled professional growth, and career-defining opportunities.
Relevance AI is well-funded by leading investors, including Bessemer Venture Partners, Insights Partners, Peak XV, and King River Capital.
As an early team member, you’ll play a key role in shaping our future—including our culture, ways of working, and even the benefits we offer. We’re laying the foundations now, and your ideas can help define what comes next.
